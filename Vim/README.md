# This Vim color scheme is under construction

NOTE THIS SUCKS DONT USE IT YET

Vim stuff is in the colors folder. If you want this theme add that your vim-config:

`.vim/colors/`
`.config/nvim/colors/`

Airline stuff is in my plugins folder.
Add that to your config folder too, this time in your autoload folder:

Vim:
'.vim/autoload/vim-airline-themes/'

Nvim:
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/git-plugins/start/vim-airline-themes/autoload/airline/themes
