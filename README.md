# Spaceduck Color Scheme
![Duck Dodgers Image :) ](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-theme/blob/master/duckdodgers.jpg "Duck Dodgers image")

This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif).

I simply wanted a dark/space-like-theme that made you feel futuristic and badass. 
I didn't really like Solarized because I thought it looked like it was made by a 5 year old.

This is my attempt at making my own color theme. It's an ongoing project.

# Contributions

Hopefully soon...

So far it's just been me and my colors.

# Credits

* Hallski's [spacedust theme](https://github.com/hallski/spacedust-theme) inspired me to create this in the first place. 
* [Vim Tokyo](https://github.com/koirand/tokyo-metro.vim) because this is mostly a ripoff of that theme.
* [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)! It's terribly pretty, and I've taken many artistic elements from them.
