# Check out my Spacedirt Color Scheme
It is a literal copy of hallski's [spacedust theme,](https://github.com/hallski/spacedust-theme) which is beautiful in itself. I have simply reduced and homogenized the colors so they can be more standardized in other versions.
I plan to continuosly update and possibley make a light theme as well. And also have a VS Code and ATOM version, of course. 
This is an ongoing project.
I used [Terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) to edit the colors, feel free to take this and make something beautiful.

NOTE: If you don't find the appropriate theme, you can export on terminal.sexy. For example, if you import the Terminal/Spacedirt.terminal into the terminal.app of Terminal.sexy, you can then export the GNOME Terminal format and any other format they have on the site.

(^ If you're interested I use the bashit framework which is cute, I'm sure ZSH is probably better but that's for nerds, at that point just use the fsh shell)
