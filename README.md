# Spaceduck Color Scheme
![Duck Dodgers Image :) ](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-theme/blob/master/duckdodgers.jpg "Duck Dodgers image")

This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif).

I simply wanted a dark/space-like-theme that made you feel futuristic and badass. 
I didn't really like Solarized because I thought it looked like it was made by a 5 year old.

This is my attempt at making my own color theme. It's is an ongoing project.

So far it's just been me and my colors.

I've used their layout as kind of inspiration for this theme too.
