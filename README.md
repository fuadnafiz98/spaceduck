# Check out my Spacedirt Color Scheme
It is a literal copy of hallski's [spacedust theme,](https://github.com/hallski/spacedust-theme) which is beautiful in itself. I have simply attempted to reduce and homogenized the colors so they can be more standardized in other versions. Mostly in the OSx Terminal.

I plan to continuosly update and possibley make a light theme as well? And also have a VS Code and ATOM version, of course. 
This is an ongoing project.
I used [Terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) to edit the colors, feel free to take this and make something beautiful too. I want this to cooler than Solarized.

NOTE: If you don't find the appropriate theme, you can export on terminal.sexy.
