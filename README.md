# Spaceduck Color Scheme
![Duck Dodgers Image :) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-theme/master/img/duckdodgers.jpg)

This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif).

I simply wanted a dark/futurustic/space-like-theme that made me feel futuristic and badass.
I didn't really like Solarized because I thought it looked like it was made by a 5 year old with a bunch of crayons.

So, this is my attempt at making my own color theme. Feel free to contribute or tell me it sucks, it's an ongoing project.

# Contributions

So far it's just been me and my colors.
