This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif). I wanted a dark/space-inspired-theme that made me feel futuristic and badass.

# Install 

TODO: Fix this

### Neovim

Clone it into your colors folder 

I recommend adding vim-polyglot for improved syntax highlighting.

`Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'`


### Slack
* Go to User Menu > Preferences > Sidebar Theme
* In the bottom of the window, look for a "customize your theme and share it with others" link
* Copy and paste the values below: 
    - `#0f111b,#8970cf,#8970cf,#ffffff,#16172d,#ecf0c1,#51a77e,#009fc5`
