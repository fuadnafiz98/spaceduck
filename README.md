# Spaceduck Color Scheme
![Duck Dodgers Image :) ](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-theme/blob/master/duckdodgers.jpg "Duck Dodgers image")

This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif).

I simply wanted a dark/space-like-theme that made you feel futuristic and badass. 
I didn't really like Solarized because I thought it looked like it was made by a 5 year old (with all the colors and all).
And, the yellow/pale-off-white background from Solarized light looks like throw-up. 

On a side-note, I do think [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) is very pretty too (if you're in between color-schemes).

So yeah, this is my attempt at making my own color theme. 
So far it's mostly a copy of hallski's [spacedust theme](https://github.com/hallski/spacedust-theme). 
There's only some minute changes; I want the purples and green to be a  bit more prominent and I wanted a darker background.

This is an ongoing project.
