# Spaceduck Color Scheme
![Duck Dodgers Image :) ](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-theme/blob/master/duckdodgers.jpg "Duck Dodgers image")

This theme is based on my inspiration from duck dodgers and [space](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2011/09/mind_blown.gif).

I simply wanted a dark/space-like-theme that made you feel futuristic and badass. 
I didn't really like Solarized because I thought it looked like it was made by a 5 year old.

On a side-note, I do think [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) is very pretty too (if you're in between color-schemes).
I've used their layout as kind of inspiration for this theme too.


So yeah, this is my attempt at making my own color theme. 
So far it's mostly a copy of hallski's [spacedust theme](https://github.com/hallski/spacedust-theme). 
There's only some minute changes; I want the purples and green to be a bit more prominent and I wanted a darker background.

It's is an ongoing project.

# Contributing

If you've ported over the colors nicely into your terminal or text editor of choice, just add a lil readme, a pic/screenshot of how it looks like, and some instructions of how to get it added in your directory. 
And then send me a pull request and I'll add your contribution :).

I really want to change the syntax highlighting for different programming languages, so I need to play with the brights and stuff.
