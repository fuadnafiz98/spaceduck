# VsCode is a little more involved


Basically in your home directory, you'll want to add to add a ".vscode/" directory.
            ~/.vscode/extensions/spacedust/
            Add the package JSON and the themes directory

Hopefully that should do it.

**NOTE**: I'm still working on this theme. It's not that pretty yet. Like cohesive, you know.
